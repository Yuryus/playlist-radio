# Playlist-radio

Here are 35 Radio Playlist files, with approximately 800 - 900 Music Radios.

You can add and listen to them using any program (phone, foobar2000, Pi, LMS...).

If using it for LMS, copy the playlist_radio folder to your Pi. In the Server menu, go to Playlists Folder, choose the path to the playlist_radio folder. Save it to trigger a scan. Then go to My Music, Playlist, and choose what you'd like to listen to.
